Clone of a fun little game.

Google or search your linux distro's repository for "primrose" to find the original.
This clone is currently the same or worse in every way.
The upside is that this version is written in ruby and is easier to hack than the original version,
which is written in C++.

Some of the features implemented:

- points per square increase with size of group
- points per square increase with secondary explosions

These features are NOT implemented:

- indication of where the second square of a pair can be placed in the form of a +.
- sound
- colors beyond green, purple and orange
- available colors bar
- available color addition / removal + countdowns
- points are visible in squares when they are earned
- points per square increase as game progresses
- smooth transition animation
- networking
- menu
- help


This version depends on rubygame. To install see:

http://rubygame.org/wiki/Installation_Instructions

On mac you need to do:

gem install rsdl

rsdl primrose_main.rb

for it to work.
